For your ear to hear a reflected sound as a distinct echo, the delay between the initial sound and the arrival of the reflected sound must be greater than about a tenth of a second. Since sound travels at roughly 340 meters (1,100 feet) per second, a sound-reflecting surface has to be at least 17 meters (56 feet) away to produce an echo.  Challenge: Our Echo Tube is about 60 meters (200 feet) long. Can you use the speed of sound (340 meters per second) to estimate the expected time delay between a sound and its echo?
