Like our eyes, computer vision systems rely heavily on edge detection to locate distinct objects. Most often, computer vision systems find edges by detecting sudden changes in brightness or color; but these systems can be fooled when light is dappled or when the edges themselves are fuzzy or blocked. Human edge detection is more sophisticated—sophisticated enough to see edges where they don’t exist. Some illusions—including the Exploratorium’s former logo—create what are called illusory contours with collections of shapes that merely suggest the presence of an edge.
