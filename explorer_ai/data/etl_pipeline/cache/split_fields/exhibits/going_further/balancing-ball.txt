Airplanes, too, fly by deflecting air. A flat wing tipped into the wind forces air downward. The reaction to the downward force of the wing on the air is the upward force of the air on the wing. You can feel this lifting force if you hold your hand out the window of a moving car and tip your hand so that it forces the air downward. A wing that’s curved on top will fly even if it isn’t tipped, thanks to what’s called the Coand ă effect , the tendency of a fluid stream to adhere to a surface it passes over.  Air passing over the curved wing top “sticks” and follows the arc of the wing, ultimately getting deflected downward. This downward deflection of air produces an upward force on the wing. The Coandă effect also makes possible the curve balls of baseball and the banana kicks of soccer.
