This exhibit is a giant version of a Winogradsky column , named after Ukrainian biologist Sergei Winogradsky. You can make your own by putting pond mud, newspaper, eggs, and water in a blender.  CYANOBACTERIA Like plants, cyanobacteria absorb carbon dioxide (C0 2 ) and produce oxygen. Unlike plants, they absorb light with a blue-green pigment, called phycocyanin.   IRON OXIDIZERS These orange bacteria live somewhat lower down, where there's less oxygen.  ANAEROBIC PHOTOSYNTHESIZERS  Anaerobic means these bacteria live where there's no oxygen. Photosynthesizers means they get energy from light.  CELLULOSE DEGRADERS AND SULPHUR REDUCERS These gray bacteria do not harvest light, but instead get energy by consuming cellulose, or plant fibers.
