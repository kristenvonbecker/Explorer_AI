The original Prisoner’s Dilemma centers on two accused criminals deciding whether or not to rat on their partner, with the least punishment only possible if both decide to trust one other. The concept applies more broadly though to economics, politics, environmental issues, and even sports. In professional cycling, for example, many athletes engage in doping out of fear of being the only person not doping. Can you think of a Prisoner’s Dilemma you’ve encountered in your own life?  This rubric details the possible outcomes based on your choice—and your partner’s. As in other Prisoner’s Dilemma scenarios, the best outcome for all requires trust on both parts.
