See live, beating human heart cells, and use your pulse to control their beating. Grab hold of the heart rate sensor and watch as the heart cells on the screen adjust their rhythmic contractions to match your heart beat. If you do a few jumping jacks, you can give those heart cells a workout!   This exhibit is part of the Cells to Self  collection, which is expected to open in 2019.
