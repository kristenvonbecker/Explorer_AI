A cup of water sitting on a table appears to just sit there. But second by second it’s losing billions of water molecules to the air through a process called evaporation . As the water evaporates, the glass of water gets lighter and lighter. A digital scale shows that it loses .0001 grams of water every second. At that rate, it takes about 16 minutes for a single drop to evaporate. And if you left the glass alone, all the water would be gone after 10 days. "I wanted to make visitors think about our perspective on Time by noticing that a process that appears to be at a stop can be moving quickly, if your sense of time was that of a redwood tree.  I was gratified to discover that the scale in the bio lab was sensitive enough to show constant change." —Exhibit Developer Erik Thogersen
