An elevated topography of silvered squares inserted between the water and the sky, Sun Swarm is an architectural intervention that collects and disperses bits of sunlight across the deck of Pier 17. Clusters of tiny mirrors on the end of steel rods reach up from a series of pier pilings, swaying with the tide in unpredictable ways. Stretching for nearly 75 feet, Sun Swarm is an understated and elegant complement to the natural light play that occurs elsewhere over the water.  Sun Swarm was redesigned and reinstalled in 2019.
