When you look at the stars—or Alicia Eggert's mirrored neon sculpture—how far back in time can you see? The speed of light is fast (about 186,000 miles per second), but even light takes time to travel. By the time the light reaches your eyes, what you see is in the past.  Moonlight bounced off the lunar surface about 1.3 seconds ago. Sunlight travels about 8 minutes 20 seconds to warm your skin. The farther out in space we look, the further back in time we see. In the case of starlight, we’re seeing stars as they were—years, centuries, thousands, even millions of years ago.   Photo courtesy of the artist.
