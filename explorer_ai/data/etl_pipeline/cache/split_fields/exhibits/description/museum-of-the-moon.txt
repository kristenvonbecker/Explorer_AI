Every culture has found scientific and artistic inspiration in Earth’s glowing satellite. Our moon acts as a cultural mirror, reflecting not just the Sun’s light, but the stories and beliefs of people around the world.  Luke Jerram’s Museum of the Moon (2016) was inspired by the huge tidal range in the artist’s home city of Bristol, England. The artwork is printed from 120 dpi NASA imagery that shows every cliff and crater at an approximate scale of 1:700,000; one centimeter represents about 7 kilometers (one inch equals about 11 miles) of the lunar surface.
