Hold hands with friends or strangers to create human circuits between poles arranged in the shape of a skewed peace sign.  Ekene Ijeoma’s interactive installation invites you to connect physically and energetically with others. Ijeoma uses a human phenomenon—your body is around 60% salty water, making it a conductor of electricity—to illuminate Peacemaker (2021) and activate networks of care.   Peacemaker appears in the Exploratorium's Black Box , a gallery space dedicated to an ongoing series of media art installations.  On view through Sunday, February 27, 2022.
