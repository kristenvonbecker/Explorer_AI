Originally created in 1971 , the Tactile Dome was designed and built by Dr. August F. Coppola (father of actor Nicolas Cage and brother of filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola and actress Talia Shire). The Tactile Dome was redesigned and rebuilt for Pier 15 and opened in 2013.  You can journey through total darkness in this twisting, turning, tactile sculpture. Walk, crawl, climb, and slide your way through a wonderland of textures using only your sense of touch as a guide.
