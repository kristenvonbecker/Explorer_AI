Immerse yourself in this shared space of meditative light play. Can you envision water (ever changing) becoming the horizon (ever constant)? Or perhaps you can imagine the ethereal events of the Big Bang—the universe’s origin as a hot, dense point; the explosion and rapid expansion of space; and finally, matter coalescing into galaxies.   Becoming Horizon (2021) fills the senses with motion, music, and dancing light for a meditative experience that is joyful and calm. This hand-crafted artwork incorporates over 100,000 handsewn mirror tiles.  On view in Glow: Discover the Art of Light , November 18, 2021–January 30, 2022.
