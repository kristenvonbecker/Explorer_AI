The seductive glow of neon once ruled skylines and storefronts around the world. Neon signs became synonymous with the late-night energy of city living.  Although neonâ€™s popularity has dimmed, artists such as Ames Palms keep its handmade beauty alive. Palms fell in love with neon in art school, where they learned the delicate craft of bending glass tubes into sculptures and signs.   Photo courtesy of the artist.
