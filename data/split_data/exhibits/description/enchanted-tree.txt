If you visited the Exploratorium in the 1970s or 1980s, you might remember this tree lighting up—mysteriously, delightfully—at the sound of clapping. “This tree was created by Burt Libe as a fantastic approach to the new field of electronic art,” the artist wrote.  A feat of engineering in 1971, this beloved work is now 50 years old. Though The Enchanted Tree no longer functions fully, it’s still a delightful expression of one tinkerer’s skill and vision. You can tap a pedal to light up the tree and its circuits. The circuit board is hand-built, unique in design, and too fragile to disassemble; its exact logic remains a mystery.
