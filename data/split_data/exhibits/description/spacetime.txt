Take a quiet journey into the infinite expanses of space and time. Inside a cube of two-way mirrors, Nick Dong’s light sculpture reflects and expands chaotically as it turns. Keep observing—for a brief moment, the chaos resolves to reveal an orderly, exact, and infinite vision. Then the cycle begins again.  “Lost in space, lost in time, found in Spacetime, ” Dong writes. He invites you to “bring your own chaos” to your observation of Spacetime (2021), an artwork that is incomplete without you.   Photo courtesy of the artist.
