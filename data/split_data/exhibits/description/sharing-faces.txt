Sit down at this new-media exhibit and you'll see someone else's face looking back at you. When you move around or make a face, your movements and expressions are matched by images of countless others who have done the same thing. How does it feel to see your expressions reflected back at you in other people's faces? Do you feel a sense of connection with others?
