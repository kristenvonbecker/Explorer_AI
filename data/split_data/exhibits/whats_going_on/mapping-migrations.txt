At this large, touch-screen exhibit, visitors can choose which animals to follow, and look at how they differ in migration speed, timing, and location. They can also see the differences between male and female migration pathways. To collect the data displayed in this exhibit, scientists tagged whales, sharks, sea turtles, and other creatures in the Pacific Ocean, then tracked their movements over time. The data has helped scientists make discoveries about where these animals go throughout the year. For example, they've learned that white sharks flock to an area 1,500 miles west of Baja California—known as the White Shark Café. The data was collected as part of the Tagging of Pacific Predators project, part of the Census of Marine Life.
