The fantastic shapes and patterns you can see in this exhibit are largely due to the strong cohesive forces between water molecules, also known as surface tension . Water molecules are polar , that is, the electric charges within them are arranged so that each molecule has a positive and a negative side. This polarity makes water molecules tend to stick strongly to one another, causing water droplets to form spheres and water surfaces to ripple as if covered in a skin of fabric.
