Zebrafish are widely studied in biology, and for good reason. Not only are they hardy and easy to grow in a lab, their embryos are translucent, so it’s easy to observe how they develop from a single cell into a newly hatched fish. A fertilized zebrafish egg develops and hatches within 48 hours. It then takes three months for it to reach adulthood.  Although zebrafish don’t look much like humans, our embryos follow a similar path during early development, so we can study zebrafish to learn about human development. For example, there are genetic mutations in zebrafish that cause heart defects that are very similar to mutations that cause defects in human hearts. You may encounter some of these mutant zebrafish in this exhibit. They’re easy to spot because their strangely shaped hearts don’t pump blood very well.
