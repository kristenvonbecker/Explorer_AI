Infrared cameras are used in some night vision systems, in industry, astronomy, and to help find heat leaks in insulated homes. Like the camera in this exhibit, rattlesnakes can “see” infrared light—but not with their eyes. Instead, they use infrared-sensing organs called pits, found between the nostril and eye. Being able to sense infrared light helps rattlesnakes and other pit vipers track their warm-blooded prey.
