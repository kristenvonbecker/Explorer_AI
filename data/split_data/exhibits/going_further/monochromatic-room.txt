The yellowish light in this room is produced by sodium vapor lamps, which are commonly used in streetlights because they’re energy efficient. They also help reduce light pollution problems at astronomical observatories. (Light pollution of a single color is easier to filter out.) Sodium vapor lamps like the one illuminating this room emit light that is monochromatic , that is, of a single color or wavelength—589 nanometers, to be precise. (click image to enlarge)
