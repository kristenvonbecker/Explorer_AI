Physicist-musician Ernst Chladni came up with the idea to use sand to reveal the pattern of vibrations on a surface in 1787. Today, some makers of violins, cellos, and similar musical instruments still use Chladni patterns to help them craft the belly and back of each instrument, the shapes of which are crucial to the instrumentâ€™s unique voice. The mathematics underlying Chladni patterns also helped shed light on the quantum mechanical understanding of electron orbital patterns.
