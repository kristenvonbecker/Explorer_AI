Radio telescopes and satellite dishes collect and focus electromagnetic waves in the same way that the Listening Vessels focus sound waves. In architecture, curved walls and domes can create acoustic effects similar to what you experience here. Statuary Hall, in Washington, D.C.â€™s Capitol Building, is legendary for its tricky acoustics. A whisper on one side of this half-domed room can be heard more than 15 meters (about 50 feet) away.
