Real comets, often referred to by astronomers as “dirty snowballs,” contain a mixture of rock, dust, and water ice, along with frozen carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, and ammonia. Dry ice has a surface temperature far colder than ordinary ice: -109° Fahrenheit, or -78.5° Celsius. For this reason it’s preferred over water ice for shipping perishable goods, with the added advantage that it leaves behind carbon dioxide gas (instead of a soggy wet mess) once its cooling work is done.
