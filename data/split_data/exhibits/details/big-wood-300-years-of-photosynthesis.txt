Developed by artist Michael Brown in collaboration with reclaimed wood specialist Evan Shively, Big Wood has been created out of a several-hundred-year-old Douglas fir split down the center to reveal its rings, immersing visitors in a fascinating study of dendrochronology. The wood of the tree forms the walls of an intimate, contemplative space with a center bench. The enormous, lacy root structure compels visitors to appreciate the complexity and sheer enormity of this grand, once-living organism.
