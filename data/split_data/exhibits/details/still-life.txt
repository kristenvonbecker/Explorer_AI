In the celebrated film Still Life , an impossibly beautiful bowl of fruit decays at an accelerated pace via time-lapse editing, transforming a timeless scene into a visceral memento mori. The work has been placed in close proximity to Energy from Death, a floor exhibit concerning decay and the transfer of energy from one form to another.
