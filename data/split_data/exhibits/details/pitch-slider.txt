This strange instrument makes sound with a vibrating metal bar. Twang to get it going, then listen as you move a slider up and back along the bar. Like a slider on a steel guitar string, moving it changes the vibration. Varying the vibration varies the pitch, so play around with the sounds. How do they change as you speed up or slow down the vibration? Can you play a tune? This exhibit was inspired by the work of Bart Hopkin , who builds and plays unusual musical instruments.
