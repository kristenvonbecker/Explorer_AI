The fluttering waves that whirl around the edge of the umbrella show how random motion can create a regular pattern. As the fabric spins it forms pockets of swirling air that set it flapping like a flag in the wind. But unlike a flag, this cloth is bound into the shape of a circle. The waves bump into each other as they spin, interacting to create patterns of evenly spaced ripples.
