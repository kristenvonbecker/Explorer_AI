 Traits this exhibit asks about:  How attached are your earlobes? Clasp your hands, interlacing your fingers. Which thumb is on top? What color are your eyes? How many freckles do you have? Do you have a widow’s peak? Do you have dimples in your cheeks?  What’s going on?  In the past, all of these traits were given as examples of things controlled by genes alone. But in most cases, there are other factors involved. You become who you are through a complicated interplay of DNA and other factors, such as the conditions in your mother’s womb, what you eat, what you do, how you were raised, and much, much more.
