 Sky Theater is a rear-projected enclosure designed to reveal and celebrate the unseen patterns of the daytime sky. Viewers enter and experience an unobscured 360° view (with correct compass orientation) of the sky in miniature, creating the illusion of a private sky-space mimicking what one would see standing atop the Fisher Bay Observatory. A composite of annotated time-lapse images allows visitors to see one year compressed into a single day, with multiple Suns—tracing the equinox and two solstices—simultaneously marching across the sky.
