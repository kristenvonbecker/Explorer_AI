The Observatory Library is the Bay Observatory’s research center, providing context and historical insight to the local landscape just beyond the windows. The library holds selected literature about regional history—including new works of merit, rare and out-of-print books, magazines, and government documents—enabling visitors to browse or conduct research. Five atlases specially prepared for the library animate archival materials to explore natural and social forces that have impacted the bay's landscape. The library also includes moving images that show scenes from local landscapes that have been eclipsed by history.
