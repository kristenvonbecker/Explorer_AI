 The Atmosphere: A Guide is a poster-essay depicting various human influences on the sky and their accumulated traces, whether chemical, narrative, spatial, or political. Visually referencing the Cloud Code Chart, another interpretive aid for looking up, the guide visualizes some ways that humans literally and figuratively occupy the present, past, and future atmosphere, organized from sea level to the exosphere.
