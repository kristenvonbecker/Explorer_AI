This work-in-progress by charismatic artist Scott Weaver has a permanent home at the Exploratorium—lucky visitors may run into the artist himself, busily making additions. It’s made from nothing but toothpicks—118,423 1 / 2 of them, at last count—and wood glue. There are 15 different entrance points for ping-pong balls, each conducting a different “tour” through the toothpick city. There are countless “Easter egg” surprises hidden in this sculpture. Can you find the toothpick heart Scott left in San Francisco? (Hint: Look in the Palace of Fine Arts rotunda.)
