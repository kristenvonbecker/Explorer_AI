This audiovisual installation uses everyday objects placed on a table that are interpreted as sound-producing marks in an "active score." Scrapple works as a simple form of augmented reality: the system scans the table surface as if it were a kind of music notation, producing a four-second music loop in real time from any objects lying there. The installation makes use of a variety of playful forms; in particular, long, flexible curves allow for the creation of variable melodies, while an assemblage of cloth shapes and small objects yield ever-changing rhythms. Visitors can experiment freely with tangible, interactive audiovisual composition.
