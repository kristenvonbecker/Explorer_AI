Katie Patersonâ€™s Timepieces provokes us to reconsider everyday timekeeping by presenting the time on other celestial bodies. These nine clocks show the current time on other planets and our moon.

But clock time depends on celestial rhythms, and solar days are radically different elsewhere in our universe.
