Although Nakayaâ€™s fog environments have been presented around the world, this is her first project in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region famous for its dramatic fog. San Francisco owes its fog largely to the California Current , a cold, southward-moving coastal current in the Pacific Ocean. Incoming air cools as it passes over this cold water, causing moisture in the air to condense into fog droplets.
