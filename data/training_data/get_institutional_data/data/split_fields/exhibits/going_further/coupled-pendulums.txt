The unfinished aesthetic of this exhibit reflects Exploratorium founder Frank Oppenheimer’s openness to tinkering with exhibit design. Made from hardware store parts and a staff member’s kitchen table, this exhibit went through many stages before it premiered on the museum’s exhibit floor in the early ’80s.  Since then, there’ve been more alterations and iterations, including removal of a motor and an anonymous addition of whimsical feet. The Exploratorium has generated a smaller do-it-yourself version of this exhibit and a full-sized swing-set of coupled pendulums. (click image to enlarge)
