At the positively charged wire, water breaks up into hydrogen ions (H + ) and oxygen gas (O 2 ), which you see as little bubbles rising from the wire. 2H 2 O --> O 2 + 4H + + 4e –  The hydrogen ions (H + ) that are left behind make the surrounding liquid acidic, so the dye turns yellow. At the negatively charged wire, water breaks up into hydroxide ions (OH - ) and hydrogen gas (H 2 ), which also rise as little bubbles from the wire. 2H 2 O + 2e – --> H 2 + 2OH –  The hydroxide ions (OH - ) that are left behind make the surrounding liquid basic (or alkaline), so the dye turns bluish-purple.   The dyes in this exhibit change color in response to changes in pH—also known as a litmus test .
