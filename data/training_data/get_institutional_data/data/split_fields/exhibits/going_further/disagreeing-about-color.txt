Variations between people in their perception of color reach an extreme in color blindness . About 1 in every 12 men (and 1 in every 200 women) are colorblind, the common name for a condition more correctly called color deficiency . Unlike ordinary human trichomats , who have three types of color-sensitive cones, most color-deficient people are dichromats , having only two types of color-sensitive cones, one most sensitive to blue light, the other to yellow light. The upshot is that colorblind people see the world in shades of blue and yellowâ€”with red and green being especially hard to tell apart.
