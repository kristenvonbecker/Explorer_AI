When cosmic rays from outer space reach the Earth’s atmosphere, they crash into air molecules and knock free many more particles. These particles go on to crash into more air molecules and create even more particles. Thus a single particle from outer space—called a primary —can create a shower of particles from the Earth’s atmosphere—called secondaries . Primaries (which are actually protons) rarely reach the Earth’s surface; almost all of the tracks in this exhibit are from secondaries (muons and electrons).
