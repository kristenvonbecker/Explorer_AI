Look closely and you may notice a corkscrew-shaped pattern on the surface of the spiraling water. This pattern is a profile view of surface waves that have formed on the inside of the vortex. Although the waves appear to be stationary, they are actually traveling up the downward-moving water. The effect is the same as a person walking up a down escalator.
