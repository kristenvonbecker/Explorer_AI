In this exhibit, dermestid beetles have the carcasses to themselves, but in the wild, they compete with many other insect scavengers. On a fresh carcass, most of the insects are flies. Dermestids and other beetles arrive later on in the decomposition process. The types of insects on a carcass can help forensic scientists estimate how long ago the animal died.
