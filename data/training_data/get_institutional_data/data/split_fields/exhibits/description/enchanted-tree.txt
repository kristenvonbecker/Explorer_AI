A feat of engineering in 1971, this beloved work is now over 50 years old. Though The Enchanted Tree no longer functions fully, it’s still a wonderful expression of one tinkerer’s skill and vision. You can tap a pedal to light up the tree and its circuits. The circuit board is hand-built, unique in design, and too fragile to disassemble; its exact logic remains a mystery.
