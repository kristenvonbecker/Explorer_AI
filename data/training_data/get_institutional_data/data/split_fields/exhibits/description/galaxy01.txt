Gaze up into this LED galaxy and share a moment of discovery with those around you. GALAXY03 (2021) is a site-specific sculpture that visualizes waves of light energy passing through the people below.  “I make site-specific, interactive light installations to connect people,” CHiKA writes. “My inspiration comes from living in opposite worlds—East and West, non-physical and physical, invisible and visible, latest technology and minimalism—and amidst Japanese philosophy, Zen, Taoism, visual content, light design, and experimental sound.”  On view in Glow: Discover the Art of Light , November 18, 2021–January 30, 2022.
