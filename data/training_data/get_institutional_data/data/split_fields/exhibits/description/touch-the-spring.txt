Touching the spring seems easy, but the image of a spring is made by a big curved concave mirror. Light from a real spring bounces off the mirror to form the image you see. If you shine a flashlight at the image of the spring, the light reflects from the mirror and lights up the real spring. Because the real spring is lit up, itâ€™s reflected image is lit up, too.
